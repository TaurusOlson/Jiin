ALIMAN ALMUTLAQ
  UNDE : Notes
  LONG 
    & Aljfaf is a small town where my extended family migrated some generations ago and where, for the summer, I have set to travel to. 
    & From a small office by the ornate city gate, a man dragged himself to the driver's window and exchanged a few words with my uncle. Aljfaf's reputation is that of an erudite Muslim city, a beacon at forefront of the Quran studies and the best versed into the technicalities of our faith.
    & At sunset, my luggage had reached the guest's bedroom, and we had but exchanged small talk about dad's work and my brother's failing health. I returned to the living room changed and washed, joining the rest of my siblings into a prayer. 
    & Trying to follow along what must have been a customary prayer of Aljfaf - I realized that perhaps no one had bothered telling me of my uncle's speech impediment, for the entirety of the prayer was but incoherence. 
    & Almost mocking the sobriety of the pray, I mumbled along.
    & Once the prayer had finished, and my uncle's elocution returned. 
    & Composedly, I inquired. "You see", my uncle began, "by trial of permutations, my faculty has researched and discovered for the optimal words and pace with which prayers should be had. 
    & The current revision of the pray has resulted from the field tests conducted at the University." 
    & From then on, I could see traces of the "Al-iman Al-mutlaq"(الإيمان المطلق), my uncle's optimal faith, reflected across Aljfaf. 
    & From people, praying at seemingly random happenstances, to my uncle opposing the Quran against the virtues that alcohol have shown in field trials. 
    & "Prayers under the influence have been fruitfully rewarded 42.5% more often.", he would say.

DEN
  UNDE : Programming
  BREF : {{Den}} is a small scripting language created for XXIIVV, and the successor to {{Mute}}, meant for optimal readability and simplicity. 
  LONG
    & Similarly to Mute, there is only one syntax, for conditions, objects, functions, etc.. 
    & For example, a variable is just a function that returns a value. A return, in Den, uses the colon character. 
    & The language uses no words and has no reserved namespace.
    & ! "Hello World" <comment># Hello World</comment>
    + Data Structures
    & There really is only 1 data structure, it follows the same to build Strings, Arrays and Lists..
    + Array
    # array : "one" "two" "three" "four" 5 6 7! array.2 <comment># two</comment>
    + Dictionary
    # dictionary  foo : bar  hello : world! dictionary.foo <comment># bar</comment>
    + Objects, Conditions, Operations
    & In our first example, we build a simple function to compare two values, and print either {_true_} or {_false_} if the values {_a_} and {_b_} are equal or not.
    # isEqual a b  ? = a b    : ! "True"  : ! "False"! isEqual 10 10 <comment># True</comment>! isEqual 10 20 <comment># False</comment>
    + Loops
    + Every function must exit, or else it runs itself into a loop. The following example shows an incrementation loop that exits once loop has equaled 10.
    # loop value  ? = value 10    : value  + value 1! loop 5 <comment># 10</comment>
    + Nested Functions</h2>
    & Objects can have nested functions, accessible like the array example above.
    # math a b  add    : + a b  substract    : - a b! math.add 5 10 <comment># 15</comment>! math.substract 5 10 <comment># -5</comment>
    + Scope
    & Starting objects with a capital letter makes it available inside other objects.
    # String a b  append    : + a bstring  a : "hello "  : String.append a "world" <comment># hello world</comment>

    + Multiplayer
    & By typing {*LOCAL*} in the login you will then find yourself battling the computer and possibly discover new animals. But the real fun begins by challenging other human summoners
    & If you wish to start your own arena, type {*HOST RABBIT*} in the splash screen input. This will initiate an arena called "rabbit" and other players will be able to join it by typing {*JOIN RABBIT*} - you don't have to pick rabbit as game name. 
    & If you want to create a nameless match, simply type {*HOST*}, without a game name, and other players will be able to join it by typing {*JOIN*} and by typing your IP Address if the other player is on the same local network.
    & To join a game over the internet, you can type {*JOIN RABBIT*} to connect to the game named "rabbit" or leave simply type {*JOIN*} to connect to a random game. If you wish to play local, you can simply type the host's IP.

DONSOL GUIDE
  UNDE : Donsol
  BREF : {{Donsol}}, designed by {{John Eternal|https://twitter.com/johneternal}}, is a game about exploring a dungeon using nothing but what you find.You play with a standard 54 poker card set, Jokers included.
  LONG
    & Shuffle the deck and draw 4 cards, equip a shield, slay all monsters, heal yourself with potions and exit the deck alive.
    - ♦Diamonds are shields
    - ♥︎Hearts are potions
    - ♠Spades are monsters
    - ♣︎Clubs and Jokers are also monsters
    + Red Cards
    & Red number cards equal their value and face cards(J,Q,K,A) equal 11
    + ♥︎ Potions
    & You begin with a max of 21 health points and can never go above. You can only drink one health potion per room.
    + ♦ Shield Cards
    & You can fight a monster without shield, but suffer full damage. Equipping a shield allows you to absorb the damage difference from the monster value. {_If you have an 8 shield equipped, by attacking a 9 monster you suffer 1 damage._}
    & Shields can only defend monsters in descending value and if you use a shield on a monster with higher or equal value to the previous, it will break. Broken shields leave you unarmored, and you take full damage.
    + Black Cards
    & Black number cards equal their value and face cards are as follows J is 11, Q is 13, K is 15, A is 17 and Jokers are both equal to 21.
    + ♠ Monster Cards
    & Once you have dealt with at least 3 cards, you can move onto the next room(set of 4 cards), moving the remainder card to the bottom of the deck.
    & Running away from the room moves the cards to the bottom of the deck. You can run away from a room you have not interacted with, once in a row.
    + Example Play
    - Open the door (Shuffle the deck and draw 4 cards)
    - The room contains a 7♦, Q♥︎, 10♠, J♣︎
    - Equip the 7♦ shield, and battle the J♣︎ (11-7=4 lost HP)
    - Battle the 10♠ (10-7=3 lost HP), drink the Q♥︎ and heal 11 HP up to max 21.
    - With the room empty we sneak into the next room.
    - The room contains A♦, K♦, K♣︎, 9♥︎
    - Equip the K♦ (replacing the 7♦), battle the K♣︎ (15-11=4 lost HP)
    - Drink the 9♥︎ and heal 9 HP up to max 21. 
    - Moving to the next room places the A♦ at the bottom of the deck.
    - The room contains A♣︎, J♣︎, 10♦, 6♠.
    - Continue making your way through the dungeon (deck) until all enemies are defeated.

    - Moving to Vancouver from Montreal, we sold most of our things. We carried with us: laptops, cameras, our two bikes, bike tools and a few kitchen things. We have been trying to be minimalist in our needs, and in the things we need to work happily. Knowing that we were to live in a small space, we limited the things that we bought a year prior to the move.
    - {*Is it worth it?*}
    - Absolutely.

NOOTROPICS

    - {{150mg Citicoline|https://www.intellimeds.co.uk/citicoline/citicoline-powder}}, powder
    & I take this stack every day for a {*sequence of 30 days, then stop for a week*} 
    - it seems to make the effect stronger when I start again at the end of the week.
    & It feels a bit like coffee, but with a light {_tunnel vision_}, the immediate effect is that of tuning out the voices in your head for a moment. When cycling on Noopept, it feels a bit like seeing wider. When coding, it feels a bit like things need to get done. I have been taking it for more than a year and I have yet to feel any negative effect. Noopept can be distracting at times, I heard that Racetams are weaker and might be more what you are looking for - I have yet to try them.

    & The simplest pillar, if you are {{Necomedre|Oquonie universe}}, is found in the second world, {{Nephtaline|Oquonie universe}}.

  BREF : {{Renaud Bedard|http://theinstructionlimit.com/}} and I showcased an experimental game at {{Prince of the Arcade}} last year but, between {{Volkenessen}}, {{Diluvium}} and {{Waiting for Horus}}, only got back to release it now. It is simply called Pico Battle and like our other {{Pico}} titled game - this game plays with colours; but this time, in multiplayer.
  LONG
    & Unlike our last game, text heavy Diluvium, Pico Battle is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby. 
    + Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    + Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black & white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    + Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.
    & Pico Battle is an entirely wordless game, and might seem offputting or hard to grasp at first. In the lobby, a robotic voice will explain the basics of the game, and take your time there to experiment with the controls and the scarce UI elements. As you get familiar with the game and its interface, you will discover strategies and enjoy it even more.
    - AI now raises a random shield before you attack with any colour
    - Fixed graphical issue on arc-link shadows
    - Escape key now quits the game if pressed in the lobby

THE SARTRE MECHANISM
  UNDE : Notes
  BREF : It was just three days before Christmas when my friend, who works the Locks & Watches Repair boutique, invited me  to his workshop, so I could witness the completion of his latest project, sold to me as the pompous "perfection of design itself". Crouched over a small heap of cogs, he did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine. His gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the hoarded studio.
    & What I perceived as a pile of junk from afar, turned out to be a beautiful clock-looking-thing, but where the needles would be, a small hand rested at the tip of a short metallic arm.
    & Its maker held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto the opened hand. Whirring and clicking into life, a second arm emerged from the curious machine and plucked a gear out of its entrails and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core naked.
    & I started in silent awe, to the busy mechanical concerto, playing its requiem. The arms eventually began to reach inside the mechanism, unbuilding its core, growing weaker as it dismantled the heavier components and moved them back into the toolbox. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had crawled back into the toolbox, ending its life.
    & The machine was indeed truly perfect.

    + Before the explosion</h2>
    & Before the Yajnev incident that shaped the location into its state during the {{first season|feu}}, Vetetrandes was a vast pale city designed by the same architect who also created the island of {{Neau}}.

VOLKENESSEN
  UNDE : Desktop
  BREF : It's a two-player, {{physics-based 2D fighting game|http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=VheiqV4AuRE}}. Each player starts with 9 random attached items on his back, and the goal is to strip the other player of his items by beating the crap out of him. When items are removed, they clutter up the playing area, making it even more cahotic and hilarious. The washing machine and sink in the background can also fall and bounce around!
  LONG
    & {_Winning game of the Montreal edition of the Global Game Jam 2012, Volkenessen is a 2D Fighting game developed by {{Renaud Bedard|http://theinstructionlimit.com/}} and myself._}
    & The game is available for download for OS X and Windows (64bits), for the non-64bits version, use the mirror on the {{Global Game Jam 2012 site|http://globalgamejam.org/2012/volkenessen}}. 
    & You {*need a controller*} to play this game, it simply won't work with a keyboard. It was tested with the XBox controller and some generic Logitech controller. It will be presented at the {{IGDA|http://www.igda.org/montreal/Jan31_DemoNight}} tomorrow evening at the demo night and publicly playable for the first time at the next {{Indies Meetup|https://www.facebook.com/events/182113635223855/}} and {{Toy Company festival|http://toycompany.cc/}} in February.
    + Controls
    & You need two gamepads (so far the Xbox wired, wireless and a Logitech generic gamepad have been tested and work) to play, there are no keyboard control fallback (yet). The controls are pretty exotic. To move around you can press either the D-Pad (or left analog stick) or the face buttons (A/B/X/Y), and the direction of the button does the same input as if you pressed that D-Pad direction. As you move, your player will throw a punch, kick or flail his ears to make you move as a result.
    & To hit the other player, you need to get close to him by hitting away from him, then hit him by moving away from him. Ramming into the opponent just doesn't do it, you need to throw punches, and depending on the impact velocity, even that might not be enough. You can throw double-punches to make sure you land a solid hit and take off an item.
