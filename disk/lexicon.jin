ALIMAN ALMUTLAQ
  UNDE : Notes
  LONG 
    & Aljfaf is a small town where my extended family migrated some generations ago and where, for the summer, I have set to travel to. 
    & From a small office by the ornate city gate, a man dragged himself to the driver's window and exchanged a few words with my uncle. Aljfaf's reputation is that of an erudite Muslim city, a beacon at forefront of the Quran studies and the best versed into the technicalities of our faith.
    & At sunset, my luggage had reached the guest's bedroom, and we had but exchanged small talk about dad's work and my brother's failing health. I returned to the living room changed and washed, joining the rest of my siblings into a prayer. 
    & Trying to follow along what must have been a customary prayer of Aljfaf - I realized that perhaps no one had bothered telling me of my uncle's speech impediment, for the entirety of the prayer was but incoherence. 
    & Almost mocking the sobriety of the pray, I mumbled along.
    & Once the prayer had finished, and my uncle's elocution returned. 
    & Composedly, I inquired. "You see", my uncle began, "by trial of permutations, my faculty has researched and discovered for the optimal words and pace with which prayers should be had. 
    & The current revision of the pray has resulted from the field tests conducted at the University." 
    & From then on, I could see traces of the "Al-iman Al-mutlaq"(الإيمان المطلق), my uncle's optimal faith, reflected across Aljfaf. 
    & From people, praying at seemingly random happenstances, to my uncle opposing the Quran against the virtues that alcohol have shown in field trials. 
    & "Prayers under the influence have been fruitfully rewarded 42.5% more often.", he would say.

DEN
  UNDE : Programming
  BREF : {{Den}} is a small scripting language created for XXIIVV, and the successor to {{Mute}}, meant for optimal readability and simplicity. 
  LONG
    & Similarly to Mute, there is only one syntax, for conditions, objects, functions, etc.. 
    & For example, a variable is just a function that returns a value. A return, in Den, uses the colon character. 
    & The language uses no words and has no reserved namespace.
    & ! "Hello World" <comment># Hello World</comment>
    + Data Structures
    & There really is only 1 data structure, it follows the same to build Strings, Arrays and Lists..
    + Array
    # array : "one" "two" "three" "four" 5 6 7! array.2 <comment># two</comment>
    + Dictionary
    # dictionary  foo : bar  hello : world! dictionary.foo <comment># bar</comment>
    + Objects, Conditions, Operations
    & In our first example, we build a simple function to compare two values, and print either {_true_} or {_false_} if the values {_a_} and {_b_} are equal or not.
    # isEqual a b  ? = a b    : ! "True"  : ! "False"! isEqual 10 10 <comment># True</comment>! isEqual 10 20 <comment># False</comment>
    + Loops
    + Every function must exit, or else it runs itself into a loop. The following example shows an incrementation loop that exits once loop has equaled 10.
    # loop value  ? = value 10    : value  + value 1! loop 5 <comment># 10</comment>
    + Nested Functions</h2><p>Objects can have nested functions, accessible like the array example above.
    # math a b  add    : + a b  substract    : - a b! math.add 5 10 <comment># 15</comment>! math.substract 5 10 <comment># -5</comment>
    + Scope
    & Starting objects with a capital letter makes it available inside other objects.
    # String a b  append    : + a bstring  a : "hello "  : String.append a "world" <comment># hello world</comment>

But the real fun begins by challenging other human summoners.</p><p>If you wish to start your own arena, type {*HOST RABBIT*} in the splash screen input. This will initiate an arena called "rabbit" and other players will be able to join it by typing {*JOIN RABBIT*} - you don't have to pick rabbit as game name. If you want to create a nameless match, simply type {*HOST*}, without a game name, and other players will be able to join it by typing {*JOIN*} and by typing your IP Address if the other player is on the same local network.</p><p>To join a game over the internet, you can type {*JOIN RABBIT*} to connect to the game named "rabbit" or leave simply type {*JOIN*} to connect to a random game. If you wish to play local, you can simply type the host's IP. </p><h2>Splash Commands</h2><p>You can enter a few commands and cheat codes into the splash field.</p><pre>Local  > <comment>{empty}</comment>    : Play against an AI summonerJoin   > <comment>{empty}</comment>    : Battle a random internet summoner       > Game Name  : Challenge a specific internet summoner       > IP Address : Challenge a local(LAN) summonerHost   > <comment>{empty}</comment>    : Create a LAN/Internet game       > Game Name  : Create a LAN/Internet game with a specific nameMute   > <comment>{empty}</comment>    : Turn the music OFF</pre><p>The game also has a few cheat codes that can be entered in the splash field, ask your friends for these codes maybe someone has found one.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The sounds and sountrack of the game were composed by <a href='Aliceffekt'>Aliceffekt</a>. There is 4 versions of the BGM available in the game, some of them are secret tracks. The song playing in the trailer is Light Powered by Deastro.</p><p>If you wish to turn off the sounds, type in {*MUTE*} in the login field. You might have heard something about cheatcodes, well, if you know any. They must be typed into the login screen.</p><h2 id='patch'>Patch 1.1</h2><p>A new version was released on june 15th 2012 including better online accessiblity, animal balancing and minor networking fixes.</p><ul class='roman'><li>You can now name your games and tell your friend to connect to it by name instead of IP!

Another game, working in a similar fashion, also released this week, Card Crawl. It seems as if this game design was overdue.</p>

You can only drink one health potion per room.</p><h3>♦ Shield Cards</h3><p>You can fight a monster without shield, but suffer full damage.<br />Equipping a shield allows you to absorb the damage difference from the monster value. {_If you have an 8 shield equipped, by attacking a 9 monster you suffer 1 damage._}</p><p>Shields can only defend monsters in descending value and if you use a shield on a monster with higher or equal value to the previous, it will break. Broken shields leave you unarmored, and you take full damage.</p><h2>Black Cards</h2><p>Black number cards equal their value and face cards are as follows J is 11, Q is 13, K is 15, A is 17 and Jokers are both equal to 21.</p><h3>♠ Monster Cards</h3><p>Once you have dealt with at least 3 cards, you can move onto the next room(set of 4 cards), moving the remainder card to the bottom of the deck.</p><p>Running away from the room moves the cards to the bottom of the deck. You can run away from a room you have not interacted with, once in a row.</p><h2>Example Play</h2><ul><li>Open the door (Shuffle the deck and draw 4 cards)</li><li>The room contains a 7♦, Q♥︎, 10♠, J♣︎</li><li>Equip the 7♦ shield, and battle the J♣︎ (11-7=4 lost HP)</li><li>Battle the 10♠ (10-7=3 lost HP), drink the Q♥︎ and heal 11 HP up to max 21.</li><li>With the room empty we sneak into the next room.</li><li>The room contains A♦, K♦, K♣︎, 9♥︎</li><li>Equip the K♦ (replacing the 7♦), battle the K♣︎ (15-11=4 lost HP)</li><li>Drink the 9♥︎ and heal 9 HP up to max 21. </li><li>Moving to the next room places the A♦ at the bottom of the deck.</li><li>The room contains A♣︎, J♣︎, 10♦, 6♠.</li><li>Continue making your way through the dungeon (deck) until all enemies are defeated.</li></ul>

FRANSSE
  UNDE : Reforms
  LONG : <style>fff {display:inline; color:white}</style><p>Fransse is an minimal version of the french language, created to contrast the necessity of the numerous exceptions and rules of the french language against their actual purposes - as well as to correlate the loss of complexity versus the loss of depth and precision, al. The goal is to strip french of irregular verbs, exceptions and homophones. This is a preliminary version of a longer piece on Fransse.</p><h3>Pronouns</h3><p>Pronouns in Fransse are made of 4 elements. The first 2 elements are the {_self element_}, and sometimes a {_target element_} onto whom a verb is affected. The last 2 element is the verb type and tense. This structure makes verb groups and conjugation obsolete for this structure allows to use any simple form of any noun as a conjugated verb.</p><table>	<tr><td colspan="3">Subject</td><td colspan="4">Verb Settings</td></tr>	<tr><td>{*Self*}</td><td>{*Target*}</td><td>{*English*}</td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333">Person</td><td>English</td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333">Tense</td><td>English</td></tr>	<tr><td>j'</td><td>m</td><td>First singular</td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333">a</td><td>Have verb</td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333">vais </td><td>past</td></tr>	<tr><td>t'</td><td>t</td><td>Second singular</td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333">e</td><td>Am verb</td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333">vai </td><td>future</td></tr>	<tr><td>i'</td><td>y</td><td>Third singular/plural</td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333"></td><td></td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333">rais</td><td>cond. past</td></tr>	<tr><td>o'</td><td>n</td><td>First plural</td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333"></td><td></td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333">rai</td><td>conf. future</td></tr>	<tr><td>v'</td><td>v</td><td>Second plural</td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333"></td><td></td><td style="border-left: 5px solid #333">la</td><td>Imperative</td></tr>	</table><pre><fff>Jtarai donne un fleur</fff> I could give you a flower</pre><h3>Topics</h3><table class='right marl20' style='width:300px'>	<tr>		<td>{*Suffix*}</td>		<td>{*Module*}</td>		<td>{*Example*}</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>-oir</td>		<td>location</td>		<td>chantoir, danseoir</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>-eur</td>		<td>agent</td>		<td>faiteur, ideeur</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>-ard</td>		<td>prejorative</td>		<td>laidard, profesard</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>-ieme</td>		<td>counter</td>		<td>rougeieme, premieme</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>-ier</td>		<td>useage</td>		<td>telephonier, chantier</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>-ant</td>		<td>happenning</td>		<td>dansant, ideant</td>	</tr></table><p>Fransse is heavily relying on the latin morphemes, making the 3 segments of a noun(prefixes, a root and a nominal suffixes) often be found within the latin boundaries. For more affixes, look for the latin affixes in the french lexicon on wikipedia. The pronouns are often omitted for they can be deduced from the verb conjugation. But they are required to transform a sentence into a question, the question form of the pronoun will follow the verb. </p><p>"Pensait-il qu t'mentais ?". <br/><i class='grey'>Did he thought you were lying ?_}</p><div class='clear'></div><h3>Verbs</h3><p>Every verb in Fransse is nominal, meaning that a verb must have a noun base equivalent. To transform a noun into a verb, if the noun is ending with a vowel, this ending vowel is removed to give place to the suffixed conjugation - a list of conjugation examples can be found bellow. There is a single verb group in Fransse and 4 tenses. The verb used in an imperative sentence will be the second persons present tense.</p><h3>Particles</h3><p>Particles will add secondary precisions to the

HIVERSAIRES GUIDE
  UNDE : Hiversaires
  LONG : <p>This walkthrough should help you get started in {{Hiversaires}}. The japanese translation was written by <a href='http://twitter.com/shinimai'>Shin Imai</a> and the german translation by <a href="https://twitter.com/Zitatwaffe">Ernst Jammermann</a>.</p><p>{*EN*} The first act begins in <a href="Forest">Forest</a>. You are presented with a white monolith with symbols, a binary terminal with a symbol that looks like a fork, a locked door with a small locker on its side and a terminal with a circular interface. The locked door will unlock if you take the fuse from the locker and insert it in the tiny door on its right.</p><p>{*JP*} Hiversairesを始めるにあたり、この道標をもって汝の助けとならん。第一幕はForestから始まる。汝は徴が刻まれた白無垢の一枚磐、鍬のごとき徴を持つ二値端末、傍らに小さき箱を備えた閉ざされた扉、そして回転式端末の前に存する。閉ざされた扉は、箱より管を得て、その右横の小さき扉の中に挿入することをもって、開かるる。</p><p>{*DE*} Der erste Akt des Spiels beginnt im <a href="Forest">Wald</a>. Du siehst Dich einem weißen Monolithen mit verschiedenen Symbolen gegenüber, des Weiteren einer Schalttafel mit einem „Gabel“-ähnlichen Symbol und zudem einer verschlossenen Tür, an deren linker Seite sich ein kleiner Spind nebst einer runden Luke in der Wand befindet. Die verschlossene Tür lässt sich öffnen, wenn Du die Batterie aus dem Spind nimmst und hinter der runden Luke zu dessen rechten einsetzt.</p><img src="img/lexicon/act1_1.png"/><p>{*EN*} Once inside <a href="Studio">the second room</a>, you are again faced with a locked door. This door will unlock with the circular interface terminal in the rightful position and lead you into the <a href="Circle">Circle</a>.</p><p>{*JP*} 一度、第二の部屋に入りしば、汝は再び閉ざされた扉に面する。回転式端末において正しき位置にあれば、この扉は開きて、汝をCircleへと導く。</p><p>{*DE*} Gehst Du durch die nun unverschlossene Tür und bist im zweiten <a href="Studio">Raum</a> angekommen, wirst Du recht bald mit einem weiteren unpassierbaren Durchgang konfrontiert. Dieser wiederum lässt sich öffnen, indem Du auf der Schalttafel im ersten Bereich die unten gezeigte Position (siehe Bild) einstellst, die auch auf dem Durchgang abgebildet ist. Dieser führt Dich weiter in den <a href="Circle">Kreis</a>.</p><img src="img/lexicon/act1_2.png"/><p>{*EN*} Depending on which position you chose for the circular terminal, you will be able to enter either the <a href="Stones">Stones</a> or the <a href="Antechannel">Antechannel</a>. You will want to enter the Stones from the Circle.</p><p>{*JP*} 汝が選択せし回転式端末の位置に準じて、汝はStonesもしくはAntechannelに入らるる。汝がCircleからStonesに入ることを欲するならば、斯くの如し。</p><p>{*DE*} Abhängig von der eingestellten Position auf besagter Schalttafel kannst Du entweder zu den <a href="Stones">Steinen</a> oder zum <a href="Antechannel">Antechannel</a> gelangen. Zunächst ist der Weg zu den Steinen der richtige (siehe Abbildung).</p><img src="img/lexicon/act1_3.png"/><p>{*EN*} The stones is the last room of the first act,  you will find a tall door on the second floor with 4 seals on it. These icons, found everywhere in the game are related with the binary interfaces. For this door to open, you will need the fork symbol (forest) and an inverted E symbol. Going back to the forest, activate the first seal, found ont he left of the monolith. Take the fuse out of the first door on your way out from inside the studio. Head to the stones and put the fuse in the fuse socket near the staircase. You will be able to enter <a href="Rainre">Rainre</a>, activate its seal and complete Act 1.</p><p>{*JP*} Stonesは第一幕における最後の部屋。汝は第二の間にて四つの封印がなされた高き扉を見出す。これらの象徴は、この遊戯において至る所に見出され、二値端末と結ばれている。この扉を開かんとするために、汝は鍬のごとき徴（Forest）と反転せしEの徴を求めよ。Forestに戻り、最初の封印を放て、彼の者は一枚磐の左にあり。戻りし際はStudioの内部から第一の扉の管を引き抜け。Stonesに向かい、きざはしの近きにありし受け口に管を差し入れよ。汝はRainreに踏み入れんことを能い、その封印を放ち、第一幕を終えん。</p><p>{*DE*} Die “Steine” stellen den letzten Raum des ersten Spielaktes dar: auf der zweiten Ebene wirst Du hier eine große Tür entdecken, auf der vier Siegel angebracht sind. Diese Zeichen, die Du überall im Spiel erkennen wirst, stehen in direktem Zusammenhang mit den dazugehörigen Schalttafeln und können über diese aktiviert werden. Um die Tür vor Dir zu öffnen, brauchst Du das "Gabel"-Symbol aus dem Wald (siehe oben) und das "E". Um beide zu aktivieren, begib Dich zunächst zurück in den Wald, wo Du auf der einen Seite des Monolithen durch betätigen des "Gabel"-Symbols das erste Zeichen aktivierst. Gehe nun durch die ehemals verschlossene Tür zurück in den zweiten Raum und entnimm durch die Klappe auf der Innenseite (!) die Batterie, welche Du anschließend bei den „Steinen“ in die Halterung in der Nähe der Treppen einsetzt, um danach das zweite Symbol "E" zu aktivieren. Nun wirst Du in der Lage sein, durch das kombinierte Siegel <a href="Rainre">Rainre</a> zu betreten und hast den ersten Akt erfolgreich gemeistert.</p>

LACONIQUE FRENCH

<p>Charmé de cette premiere ouverture, j’ai voulu commencer au-moins l’exécution d’un projet que les autres ne font qu’indiquer ; & je crois avoir trouvé sur tout cela un système des plus naturels & des plus faciles. Mon dessein n’est pas au reste de former un langage universel à l’usage de plusieurs nations. Cette entreprise ne peut convenir qu’aux académies savantes que nous avons en Europe, supposé encore qu’elles travaillassent de concert & sous les auspices des puissances. J’indique seulement aux curieux un langage laconique & simple que l’on saisit d’abord, & qui peut être varié à l’infini ; langage enfin avec lequel on est bientôt en état de parler & d’écrire, de maniere à n’être entendu que par ceux qui en auront la clé.</p>

<p>L’usage des conjugaisons dans les langues savantes, est d’exprimer en un seul mot une action, la personne qui fait cette action, & le tems où elle se fait. {_Scribo_}, j’écris, ne signifie pas simplement l’action d’écrire, il signifie encore que c’est moi qui écris, & que j’écris à-présent. Cette mécanique, toute belle qu’elle est, ne nous convient pas ; il nous faut quelque chose de plus constant & de plus uniforme. Voici donc tout notre plan de conjugaison.</p>

LANGUAGE OF THE BIRDS
  UNDE : Notes
  LONG : <p>I have been pondering what a conceptually perfect {{language}} could look like; a language so precise that it fully expresses an idea in all its infinite details.</p>

<p>
Immortals speak not with words;<br/>
But wait for things to happen<br/>
And merely points at them.

LEVITOV
  UNDE : Voynich
  LONG : <pre>From: j.guy@trl.OZ.AU (Jacques Guy)Date: Tue, 10 Dec 91 14:46:55 ESTSubject: Levitov - review            ON LEVITOV'S DECIPHERMENT OF THE VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT                        Jacques B.M. Guy                          (9 Dec 1991)This assessment of Levitov's decipherment of the Voynich manuscript is areworked version of a posting I made on sci.crypt during the first week ofDecember 1991. I was moved to write it by a short remark in another postingthat the review published in Cryptologia gave Levitov's decipherment asplausible, and that it had not been challenged since. Alas, I could neversecure a copy of Levitov's book, and had to rely entirely on pp.21-31, ofwhich Michael Barlow, who had reviewed Levitov's book in Cryptologia, hadsent me photocopies. Levitov's understanding of the Cathar religion and itsrites, from what I could piece together from the review in Cryptologia,and which are central to his decipherment of the Voynich manuscript whichhe claims is a Cathar prayer book, is, to say the least, rather at oddswith what Fernand Niel wrote in his "Albigeois et Cathares" (Paris: PressesUniversitaires de France, 1955).From the "Voynich alphabet" pp.25-27, I made a list of the letters of theVoynich language as Levitov interprets it, and added phonetic descriptionsof the sounds which I thought Levitov meant to describe. The leftmostcolumn contains the number of the letter as given by Levitov. The secondcolumn contains Levitov's transcription; the third, Currier's; theremaining columns its phonetic value, in the International PhoneticAlphabet, and the corresponding descriptions in standard linguistic jargonand, approximately, in plain English. I have used the following capitalletters for lack of the special international phonetic symbols:E for the Greek letter "epsilon"O for the letter that looks like a mirror-image of "c"C for c-cedillaT for the Greek letter "theta"The colon (:) means that the sound represented by the preceding letter islong, e.g. "i:" is a long "i".

IPA    VID    X      vid    VIL    Q      vil    VITH   W      viT    VIT    Y      vitNote how Levitov distinguishes between forms which Currier must haveconsidered to be too close to be likely to represent separate letters, andhow what are clearly single letters are interpreted as syllables byLevitov: letters #18, and #21 to 25. Levitov further remarks that #21 canbe reversed to read "va", and that "these letters can be pierced by thelooped letters. E.G. [variant of Currier's Q] = AVIL or [other variant ofQ] = VILA". The first variant of #21, read AV by Levitov, has the loop ofits left half closed (o-like rather than c-like); the second variant, readVA by Levitov, has the loop of its right half closed, that of left halfopen.Of #22a and 22b Levitov remarks: "Fairly rare but has to be reckoned withfrom time to time". I have never encountered them in the reproductions Ihave seen.Levitov remarks that #12, #14, #23, #24 and #25 occur only word-finally,which is, as far as I have seen, correct.In what follows I shall use these conventions: a letter or a word in squarebrackets ([]) shall be a transcription using the International PhoneticAlphabet, in angle brackets (<>) following Currier, without bracketsfollowing Levitov.Levitov's is a language with 6 vowels:[a] (#1) , [e] (#1 again), [O] (#1 again), [E] (#4), [i] (#6), and [i:](#7). Letter #8, <CCC> is not a vowel, but a combination of two vowels:[i:] (#7) and probably [E] (#4). Levitov writes that the language isderived from Dutch. If so, it has lost the "oo" sound (English spelling;"oe" in Dutch spelling), and the three front rounded vowels of Dutch: "u"as in "U" ("you", polite), "eu" as in "deur" ("door"), "u" as in "vlug"("quick"). Note that out of six vowels, three are confused under the sameletter (#1), even though they sound very different from one another: [a],[e], [O]. Just imagine that you had no way of distinguishing between"last", "lest" and "lost" when writing in English, and you'll have a fairidea of the consequences.Let us now look at the consonants. I will put them in a matrix, with thepoints of articulation in one dimension, and the manner of articulation inthe other (it's all standard procedure when analyzing a language).Parentheses around a letter will mean that I could not tell where to placeit exactly, and just took a guess. Thus, using the International PhoneticAlphabet (without square brackets for clarity):                     labial     dental  palatal   velar             nasal     m          n       voiced stop                d     unvoiced stop                t                 k  voiced fricative     v         (T)unvoiced fricative     f          s        C           lateral                l         trill (?)               (r)Note that there are only twelve consonant sounds. That is unheard of for aEuropean language. No European language has so few consonant sounds.Spanish, which has very few sounds (only five vowels), has seventeendistinct consonants sounds, plus two semi-consonants. Dutch has from 18 to20 consonants (depending on speakers, and how you analyze the sounds.) Whatis also extraordinary in Levitov's language is that it lacks a [g], and*BOTH* [b] and [p]. I cannot think of one single language in the world thatlacks both [b] and [p]. Levitov also says that [m] occurs onlyword-finally, never at the beginning, nor in the middle of a word. That iscorrect: the letter he says is [m] is always word-final in thereproductions I have seen of the Voynich MS. But no language I know ofbehaves like that. All have an [m] (except one American Indian language,which is very famous for that, and the name of which I cannot recall). Insome languages, there is a position where [m] never appears, and that isword-finally, exactly the reverse of Levitov's language.What does Levitov say about the origin of the language?"The language was very much standardized. It was an application of apolyglot oral tongue into a literary language which would be understandableto people who did not understand Latin and to whom this language could beread."At first reading, I would be tempted to dismiss it all as nonsense:"polyglot oral tongue" is meaningless babble to the linguist in me. ButLevitov is a medical doctor, so allowances must be made. The best meaning Ican read into "polyglot oral tongue" is "a language that had never beenwritten before and which had taken words from many different languages".That is perfectly reasonable: English for one, has done that. Half itsvocabulary is Norman French, and some of the commonest words havenon-Anglo-Saxon origins. "Sky", for instance, is a Danish word. So far, sogood.Levitov continues: "The Voynich is actually a simple language because itfollows set rules and has a very limited vocabulary.... There is adeliberate duality and plurality of words in the Voynich and much use ofapostrophism".By "duality and plurality of words" Levitov means that the words are highlyambiguous, most words having two or more different meanings. I could onlyguess at what he meant by apostrophism: running words together, leavingbits out, as we do in English: can not --> cannot --> can't, is not -->ain't. Later, I looked up "apostrophism" in various dictionaries, and foundit in the complete Oxford, meaning almost exactly what I had guessed: "Toomit one of more letters of a word; to mark with the sign (') the omissionof letters".In the summary of the Voynich language according to Levitov which follows,I shall transliterate the letters as Levitov does, with these provisions:I shall use only lowercase letters, distinguishing this transliterationfrom Levitov's, who uses only uppercase letters.Letter #1, Currier's <0>, shall always be transliterated by "a"; but bearin mind that Levitov transliterates it A, AH, AY, AI, or AW, by which aremeant the sounds [a], [e] and [O].Levitov gives a list of verbs in the infinitive. In the Voynich languagethe infinitive of verbs ends in -en, just like in Dutch and in German. Ihave removed that grammatical ending in the list which follows, and givenprobable etymologies in parentheses (Levitov gives none):     Lev.   Cur.ad   AID   <0F>      = to aid, help  ("aid")ak   AIK   <0R>      = to ache, pain ("ache")al   AIL   <0P>      = to ail ("ail")and  AWND  <0EF>     = to undergo the "Endura" rite (probably from                       "under", Dutch "onder", German "unter")d    D     <F>       = to die ("d[ie]")fad  FAID  <40F>     = to be for help (from  f= for and  ad=aid)fal  FAIL  <40P>     = to fail ("fail")fil  FIL   <4CP>     = to be for illness (from: f=for and il=ill)il   IL    <CP>      = to be ill ("ill")k    K     <R>       = to understand ("ken", Dutch and German "kennen"                       meaning "to know")l    L     <P>       = to lie deathly ill, in extremis ("lie", "lay")s    S     <2>       = to see ("see", Dutch "zien", German "sehen")t    T     <8>       = to do, treat (German "tun" = to do)v    V     <S>       = to will ("will" or Latin "volo" perhaps)vid  VID   <SCF>     = to be with death (from vi=with and d=die)vil  VIL   <SCP>     = to want, wish, desire (German "willen")vis  VIS   <SC2>     = to know  ("wit", German "wissen", Dutch "weten")vit  VIT   <SC8>     = to know  (ditto)vit  VIT   <Y>       = to know  (ditto)vith VITH  <W>       = to use   (no idea, Latin "uti" perhaps?)vi   VI    <SC>      = to be the way (Latin "via")ech  ECH   <AR>      = to be each ("each")aeea AEEA  <0CC0>    = to eye, look at ("eye", Dutch "oog")en   EN    <AE>      = to do (no idea)                       Example given by Levitov: ENDEN "to do to death"                       made up of EN (to do), D (to die) and EN (infinitive                       ending). But simply END = to end (German "enden")                       would be just as plausible.More vocabulary (Levitov gives no transcription for <AM> and <AN>):em         <AM>     = he or they (masculine) ("him")er         <AN>     = her or they (feminine) ("her")eth  ETH   <9>      = it or they ("it" or perhaps "they" or Dutch "het")an   AWN   <0E>     = one ("one", Dutch "een")No European language I know fails to distinguish between singular andplural in its first and third person pronouns (i.e. I vs we, he/she/it vsthey)."There are no declensions of nouns or conjugation of verbs. Only thepresent tense is used" says Levitov.Examples:den             <FAE>  = to die (infinitive) (d = die, -en = infinitive)deth    DETH    <F9>   = it/they die (d = die, eT = it/they)                         diteth DITETH <FC89> = it does die (d = die, t =                         do, eth = it/they, with an "i" added to make it                         easier to pronounce, which is quite common and                         natural in languages)But Levitov contradicts himself immediately, giving another tense (knownas present progressive in English grammar):dieth   DIETH   <FC9>   = it is dyingBut I may be unfair there, perhaps it is a compound: d = die, i = -ing,eth = it/they.Plurals are formed by suffixing "s" in one part of the MS, "eth" inanother: thus AWNS <0E2> or AWNETH <0E9> = ones. Such a plural formationcannot be of Dutch nor of German origin. Dutch forms its plurals bysuffixing -en, German -n, -en, -er, or -e (I disregard here the umlaut,since Levitov's language exhibits no such phenomenon). The few pluralswhich those two languages have ending in -s are of foreign origin e.g.German Auto, pl. Autos "motorcar". In my view, the plural formationdescribed by Levitov is copied on English, and the alternate plural ending-eth is inspired by a false analogy: "speaks" vs "speaketh" of English.More words and expressions according to Levitov, who gives the first eightlisted here only in the Voynich alphabet, without his readings ortranscriptions:wians        <ZC0E2> = we ones (wi = we, Dutch "wie", an = one, s = plural)vian         <SC0E>  = one way (vi = way, an = one)wia          <ZC0>   = one who (wi = who, a = one)va           <S0>    = one will (v = will, a = one)wa           <Z0>    = whowi           <ZC>    = whowieth        <ZC9>   = who, it (wi = who, eth = it)witeth       <ZC89>  = who does it (wi = who, t = do, eth = it/they)weth   WETH  <Z9>    = who it is (wi = who, eth = it, then the i of wi is                       lost (apostrophized), giving weth)ker    KER   <R4N>   = she understands (k = understand, er =she)At this stage I would like to comment that we are here in the presence of aGermanic language which behaves very, very strangely in the way of themeanings of its compound words. For instance, "viden" (to be with death) ismade up of the words for "with", "die" and the infinitive suffix. I am surethat Levitov here was thinking of a construction like German "mitkommen"which means "to come along" ("to with-come"). I suppose I could say "Bitte,sterben Sie mit" on the same model as "Bitte, kommen Sie mit" ("Come withme/us, please), thereby making up a verb "mitsterben", but that would mean"to die together with someone else", not "to be with death". Next, the wordorder in many "apostrophized" groups of words (but note that a word oftenconsists of just one single letter), is the reverse of that of Germanic.For instance VIAN "one way" literally "way one" is the reverse of Dutch eenweg, German ein Weg, and of course, of English "one way". Ditto for WIA"one who", VA "one will", KER "she understands" etc. Admittedly theinversion of the subject is quite common in German ("Ploetzlish dacht ich:Suddenly thought I") but it is governed by strict, clear-cut grammaticalrules, conspicuously absent in the two sentences translated on p.31 of theexcept from his book upon which I am drawing for these comments.Let us then see how Levitov translates a whole sentence. Since he does notexplain how he breaks up those compound words I have tried to do so usingthe vocabulary and grammar he provides in those pages. My tentativeexplanations are in parentheses.thanvieth   faditeth wan  athviteth anthviteth   atwiteth  aneth<B0ESC9     40FC89   Z0E  0BSC89    0EBSC89      0VZ89     0E9>THAWNVIETH FAIDITETH WAWN ATHAVITEH AWNTHIVITETH ATAWITETH AWNETH>thanvieth = the one way (th = the (?), an = one, vi =way, eth = it)faditeth  = doing for help (f = for, ad = aid, i = -ing, t = do, eth = it)wan       = person (wi/wa = who, an = one)athviteth = one that one knows (a = one, th = that, vit = know, eth = it.            Here, Levitov adds one extra letter, A, which is not in the            text, getting his ATHAVITEH, which provides the second "one"            of his translation)anthviteth= one that knows (an =one, th = that, vit = know, eth = it)atwiteth  = one treats one who does it (a = one, t = do, wi = who, t = do,            eth = it. Literally: "one does [one] who does it". The first            "do" is translated as "treat", the second "one" is again added            by Levitov: he inserts an A, which gives him ATAWITETH)aneth =     ones (an = one, -eth = the plural ending)Note that in the first word, thanvieth, the word for "one" (an, AWN, <0E>),precedes the word for "way" (vi, VI, <SC>), although Levitov gave it asfollowing earlier on: vian <SC0E> "one way".Levitov's translation of the above is: "the one way for helping a personwho needs it, is to know one of the ones who do treat one".Need I say more?As an exercise, here is the last sentence on p.31, with its word-for-wordtranslation by Levitov. I leave you to work it out, and to figure out whatit might possibly mean. I do not have Levitov's translation of the last twowords of the sentence, my copy stopping at p.31, but they are easy todecipher, given the vocabularies and examples above.

When cycling on Noopept, it feels a bit like seeing wider. When coding, it feels a bit like things need to get done. I have been taking it for more than a year and I have yet to feel any negative effect.

PICO BATTLE
  UNDE : Desktop
  LONG : <p>{{Renaud Bedard|http://theinstructionlimit.com/}} and I showcased an experimental game at {{Prince of the Arcade}} last year but, between {{Volkenessen}}, {{Diluvium}} and {{Waiting for Horus}}, only got back to release it now. It is simply called Pico Battle and like our other {{Pico}} titled game - this game plays with colours; but this time, in multiplayer.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/et58Ndob9M4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Unlike our last game, text heavy Diluvium, Pico Battle is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby. </p><h2>Lobby</h2><p>Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.</p><h2>Shielding</h2><p>To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black & white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.</p><h2>Shooting</h2><p>To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.</p><p>Pico Battle is an entirely wordless game, and might seem offputting or hard to grasp at first. In the lobby, a robotic voice will explain the basics of the game, and take your time there to experiment with the controls and the scarce UI elements. As you get familiar with the game and its interface, you will discover strategies and enjoy it even more.</p><h2>Update 1.1</h2><ul><li>Fixed bug where the AI wouldn’t defend itself if it is challenged too quickly</li><li>AI now raises a random shield before you attack with any colour</li><li>Fixed graphical issue on arc-link shadows</li><li>Escape key now quits the game if pressed in the lobby</li></ul>

RAIN BOW
  UNDE : misc
  LONG : <p><strong>RAIN+BOW</strong> is game I made with <a href="http://theinstructionlimit.com/raincrossbow">Renaud Bedard</a> as <em><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Collegiennes" title="Les Collégiennes " homepage""="">Les Collégiennes</a></em> during <a href="http://www.tojam.ca/history/2011.asp" title="TOJam 6 Homepage">TOJam Sixty Times</a> in 2011, and lay on the backburner for many years until it was resurrected for a showing at <a href="http://www.gamercamp.ca/news/share-your-tojam-memories-with-tojamxoxo/" title="Gamercamp TOJam Retrospective">Gamercamp</a> in 2013. We finally took the time to add polishing touches and add gamepad support, so I’m happy to release this version as the final public build!</p>

<p>RAIN+BOW is a <em>bullet hell</em>, or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_'em_up" title="Shoot 'em up">shmup</a> where you need to make your way through a sea of bullets and enemies and hopefully kill some of them in the process. There is no score tracking, but the game tracks how far you were able to get and remembers your highest “score” for this playthrough. You have no health; a single bullet hitting your head will kill you, but as is usual in those kind of games, the hitbox is much smaller than the character.</p>
<p>The game was selected to be presented at the Toronto <a href='http://www.gamercamp.ca/news/share-your-tojam-memories-with-tojamxoxo/'>Gamercamp</a>, and the game was re-released for the occasion.</p><p>There are three weapons at your disposal : </p><ul><li><strong>RAIN (-)</strong> : The “machine gun” continuous firing weapon, which does little damage but will grind away at oncoming enemies</li><li><strong>CROSS (+)</strong> : The auto-guided missiles, which you can’t aim but will target nearby enemies and will clear up enemies behind you</li><li><strong>BOW (|)</strong> : The laser weapon, which does take its time to charge but inflicts major damage, especially effective against blue “shield” enemies and columns of weaker enemies</li></ul><p>Sometimes you’ll see an orange cat presenting you a power-up for one of your weapons; definitely kill that guy and grab the powerup to get a more effective firing rate and effectiveness, and if you reach level 3, a temporary ultra-powerful rainbow firing mode for that weapon.</p><p>You might think that spamming all three weapons at once is a good idea, but the firing rate is halved for every simultaneous weapon, which means you should prioritize the one you think is best suited for the situation, and fire off CROSS missiles every once in a while.</p><p>RAIN+BOW was made in Unity, with the models made in Cinema4D by Devine, and original music also created on the jam site by him back in 2011. It doesn’t use textures at all (all flat-coloured materials), and we even avoided transparency in favour of rapidly flashing entities on and off, to give an even more psychedelic and retro-arcadey feel to the game.<br>The levels are randomly generated based on predefined “events” that are presented in a random order, with some variation, in a very simplistic Spelunky-like way. Game difficulty varies wildly because the algorithms for level generation are quite crude, but it ends up being challenging and fun every time, which is what counts,… right?</p><p>Enjoy! And let me know if you get crazy high scores. :)</p>

THE SARTRE MECHANISM
  UNDE : Notes
  LONG : <p>It was just three days before Christmas when my friend, who works the Locks & Watches Repair boutique, invited me  to his workshop, so I could witness the completion of his latest project, sold to me as the pompous "perfection of design itself". Crouched over a small heap of cogs, he did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine. His gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the hoarded studio.</p><p>What I perceived as a pile of junk from afar, turned out to be a beautiful clock-looking-thing, but where the needles would be, a small hand rested at the tip of a short metallic arm.</p><p>Its maker held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto the opened hand. Whirring and clicking into life, a second arm emerged from the curious machine and plucked a gear out of its entrails and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core naked.</p><p>I started in silent awe, to the busy mechanical concerto, playing its requiem. The arms eventually began to reach inside the mechanism, unbuilding its core, growing weaker as it dismantled the heavier components and moved them back into the toolbox. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had crawled back into the toolbox, ending its life.</p><p>The machine was indeed truly perfect. </p><p>{_Originally written by Voidshaper, <br />Edited by Devine Lu Linvega_}</p>

VAST
  UNDE : Physical
  LONG : <p>I recently found myself illustrating {{Elodie|http://noirmirroir.com}}'s abstract book "{{Vast - the perfect, the circular, the subjugated|http://noirmirroir.com/vast}}". A strangely perfect nonsensical coffee table curiosity that grabbed me from the moment I heard of its ties with some of the same Borgesian concepts that have also been exploring lately.</p> <p>I have created a series of ink fractals to ornate the book’s preface, table of content and cover. The book is a unique piece of cryptography that is somehow narrative in its unintelligibleness.</p>

VETETRANDES
  UNDE : Dinaisth
  LONG : <p>{{Vetetrandes}}, ex-{{Yajnev}}, is an island located on the southern hemisphere of {{Dinaisth}}.</p><p>The observable portion of the island appears as broken structures remains of the city that stood there, Yajnev. The story goes that, before the explosion, a scientist with {_absolutely nothing_} inside her, got into an accident and the integrity of her skin released the pocket of void it contained onto Yajnev.</p><h2>Before the explosion</h2><p>Before the Yajnev incident that shaped the location into its state during the {{first season|feu}}, Vetetrandes was a vast pale city designed by the same architect who also created the island of {{Neau}}.</p><p>Not much is known about the regions of the Vetetrandes, the incident has left the sector unchanging and untouchable. Various experiments were held by the {{Ehrivevnv}} to navigate through the collapse, with no avail. </p>

VOLKENESSEN
  UNDE : Desktop
  LONG : <p>It's a two-player, {{physics-based 2D fighting game|http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=VheiqV4AuRE}}. Each player starts with 9 random attached items on his back, and the goal is to strip the other player of his items by beating the crap out of him. When items are removed, they clutter up the playing area, making it even more cahotic and hilarious. The washing machine and sink in the background can also fall and bounce around!</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/VheiqV4AuRE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>{_Winning game of the Montreal edition of the Global Game Jam 2012, Volkenessen is a 2D Fighting game developed by {{Renaud Bedard|http://theinstructionlimit.com/}} and myself._}</p>

<p>The game is available for download for OS X and Windows (64bits), for the non-64bits version, use the mirror on the {{Global Game Jam 2012 site|http://globalgamejam.org/2012/volkenessen}}. You {*need a controller*} to play this game, it simply won't work with a keyboard. It was tested with the XBox controller and some generic Logitech controller. It will be presented at the {{IGDA|http://www.igda.org/montreal/Jan31_DemoNight}} tomorrow evening at the demo night and publicly playable for the first time at the next {{Indies Meetup|https://www.facebook.com/events/182113635223855/}} and {{Toy Company festival|http://toycompany.cc/}} in February. </p>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<p>You need two gamepads (so far the Xbox wired, wireless and a Logitech generic gamepad have been tested and work) to play, there are no keyboard control fallback (yet). The controls are pretty exotic. To move around you can press either the D-Pad (or left analog stick) or the face buttons (A/B/X/Y), and the direction of the button does the same input as if you pressed that D-Pad direction. As you move, your player will throw a punch, kick or flail his ears to make you move as a result.</p>

<p>To hit the other player, you need to get close to him by hitting away from him, then hit him by moving away from him. Ramming into the opponent just doesn't do it, you need to throw punches, and depending on the impact velocity, even that might not be enough. You can throw double-punches to make sure you land a solid hit and take off an item.</p>
